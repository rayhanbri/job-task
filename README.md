# 🛒 Product Management App

A **Next.js 13 full-stack web application** with authentication (Google & Credentials via NextAuth) and MongoDB integration.  
Users can log in, add products, and view them.  
Unauthenticated users can still see the "Add Product" link in the navbar, but will be redirected to the login page if they try to access it.
